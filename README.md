# Review Sentiment Analysis using HMM

User-generated content in social media contain very meaningful information about public sentiment and stance and require automated methods to analyze them extract knowledge from them. The recognition of sentiments, emotions and attitudes in textual data is necessary for understanding public stance and is highly desired for various services and procedures. In this work, we examine the performance of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in the recognition of sentiments and opinions in text. Hidden Markov Models constitute a quite suitable approach given the special characteristics of the textual data. In particular, they can utilize the sequential nature of textual data, a piece of information that traditional machine learning approaches fail to fully take into account.
